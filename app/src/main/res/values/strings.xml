    <string name="about">The Outdoorsman\'s Waypoint Plotter is a simple and lightweight tool for plotting waypoints on a map.  Plot points as you go, then easily regain your bearings with the built-in compass.  Record location notes with speech recognition with minimal use of the keyboard, or record notes the old-fashioned way by using the on-screen keyboard.  Perfect for use in cold climates, where this tool can be used without de-gloving (Try using your nose!).</string>
